# PixelPrep v2.1.0 - Quick Test Execution Guide

## 🚀 **5-Minute Smoke Test**

**Goal**: Verify all new UX features work in primary browser
**Time**: ~5 minutes
**Environment**: Production (https://third-south-capital.github.io/pixelprep/)

### Critical Path Test
1. **Upload**: Drag/drop image → verify onboarding tooltip appears
2. **Recommend**: Verify smart preset recommendation with visual badge
3. **Preview**: Check size reduction preview displays
4. **Auto-Process**: Select preset → observe 1.2s auto-start countdown
5. **Progress**: Verify real-time processing phases (4 steps)
6. **Complete**: Download works → prominent "Optimize Another" CTA appears

**Pass Criteria**: All 6 steps complete without errors

## 🐛 **Common Issues to Watch For**

### Animation Issues
- [ ] **Choppy animations**: Especially on mobile devices
- [ ] **Stuck loading states**: Auto-processing timer doesn't clear
- [ ] **Double tooltips**: Onboarding state management issues

### Layout Issues
- [ ] **Mobile tooltips**: Position outside viewport on small screens
- [ ] **CTA button**: Too small for touch on mobile
- [ ] **Progress indicator**: Doesn't stack properly on narrow screens

### State Management
- [ ] **Timer conflicts**: Multiple auto-processing attempts
- [ ] **Memory leaks**: Blob URLs not cleaned up after multiple optimizations
- [ ] **Broken reset**: State doesn't clear properly on "Optimize Another"

### Performance
- [ ] **Slow animations**: Frame rate drops during processing
- [ ] **Large bundle**: New components significantly increase load time
- [ ] **Memory growth**: Multiple optimizations cause memory buildup

## 📋 **Pre-Production Checklist**

### Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean (no errors/warnings)
- [ ] ESLint passes without violations
- [ ] All new components have proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Console.log statements removed from production code

### Performance
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score >85
- [ ] First contentful paint <1.5s
- [ ] No memory leaks after 10 optimizations
- [ ] Smooth animations on target devices

### Functionality
- [ ] All tooltips position correctly
- [ ] Auto-processing timer works reliably
- [ ] File size estimates within ±20% accuracy
- [ ] Progress indicator reflects actual processing stages
- [ ] Reset functionality preserves appropriate state

### Regression Testing
- [ ] File upload/download works unchanged
- [ ] All existing presets function correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow unaffected (when enabled)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works with new components
- [ ] Celebration banner displays accurate savings

## 🎯 **Release Decision Framework**

### ✅ **Green Light Criteria**
- All P0 tests pass in Chrome + Safari
- No regressions in core functionality
- Mobile experience acceptable
- No critical console errors

### ⚠️ **Yellow Light (Fix Fast)**
- Minor animation glitches
- Non-critical tooltip positioning issues
- Performance slightly below target
- Some edge case errors

### 🛑 **Red Light (Do Not Deploy)**
- Auto-processing breaks upload flow
- Memory leaks in production
- Mobile completely broken
- Core functionality regressed

## 📞 **Emergency Rollback Plan**

If critical issues discovered post-deployment:

### Quick Rollback (5 minutes)
1. Revert frontend deployment to v2.0.3 commit
2. Clear CDN cache if applicable
3. Verify site functionality restored

### Component-Level Disable
If only specific features problematic:
1. Comment out new component imports in App.tsx
2. Remove onboarding tooltip wrappers
3. Disable auto-processing timer
4. Keep existing user flow intact

### Monitoring During Launch
- [ ] Watch for increased error rates in logs
- [ ] Monitor user completion rates
- [ ] Check for increased bounce rates
- [ ] Verify mobile traffic not affected
